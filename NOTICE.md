This repository incorporates materials as listed below or described in the code.

Initially, the open source project [RE&CT](https://github.com/atc-project/atc-react) was taken as a basis, which is [distributed under the Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/atc-project/atc-react/blob/master/LICENSE). The code base has been almost completely rewritten, while similar functionality and ideas have been preserved. Code sections from RE&CT remained in the files [utils.py](https://github.com/Security-Experts-Community/ERMACK/blob/develop/ermack/utils/utils.py) and [attack_mapping.py](https: //github.com/Security-Experts-Community/ERMACK/blob/develop/ermack/utils/attack_mapping.py). At an early stage in the development of the project, the response actions, for the most part, are taken from RE&CT without changes and are located along the path [/data/en/response_actions](https://github.com/Security-Experts-Community/ERMACK/tree/develop /data/en/response_actions). Response actions' and response playbooks' files may be modified as development progresses.
