extended_description: |
  A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.
  A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.
  While the major function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients.
  This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.
