description: |
  A host is a computer or other device, typically connected to a computer network. 
  A network host may offer information resources, services, and applications to users or other nodes on the network. 
  A network host is a network node that is assigned a network layer host address. 
  Network hosts that participate in applications that use the client-server model of computing, 
  are classified as server or client systems. Network hosts may also function
  as nodes in peer-to-peer applications, in which all nodes share and consume resources in an equipotent manner.
