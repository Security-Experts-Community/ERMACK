description: |
  An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected
  to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 
  An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. 
  Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. 
  However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, 
  a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.
