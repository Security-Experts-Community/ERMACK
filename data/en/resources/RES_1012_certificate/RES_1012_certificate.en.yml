description: |
  In cryptography, a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, 
  is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. 
  The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner 
  (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified 
  the certificate's contents (called the issuer). If the signature is valid, 
  and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate 
  securely with the certificate's subject.
