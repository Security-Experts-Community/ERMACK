description: |
  In computing, a login session is the period of activity between a user logging in and logging out of a (multi-user)
  system. On Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a login session takes one of two main forms:
  (a) When a textual user interface is used, a login session is represented as a kernel session -- a collection
  of process groups with the logout action managed by a session leader, 
  and (b) Where an X display manager is employed, a login session is considered to be the lifetime
  of a designated user process that the display manager invokes.
