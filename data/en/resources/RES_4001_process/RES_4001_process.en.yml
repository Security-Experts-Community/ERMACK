description: |
  A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity. 
  Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute
  instructions concurrently. A computer program is a passive collection of instructions,
  while a process is the actual execution of those instructions. 
  Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, 
  opening up several instances of the same program often means more than one process is being executed.
