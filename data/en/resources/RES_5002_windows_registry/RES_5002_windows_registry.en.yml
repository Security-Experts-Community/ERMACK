description: |
  The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system 
  and for applications that opt to use the registry. The kernel, device drivers, services, Security Accounts Manager, 
  and user interface can all use the registry. The registry also allows access to counters for profiling system performance.
