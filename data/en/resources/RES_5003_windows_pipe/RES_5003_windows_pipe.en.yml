description: |
  Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. 
  In the strictest sense, a pipe is a single segment of a pipeline, allowing one process to pass information forward 
  to another. Network pipes allow processes on different hosts to interact.
  Named Pipe - mechanisms that allow inter-process communication locally or over the network. 
  A named pipe is usually found as a file and processes attach to it.
