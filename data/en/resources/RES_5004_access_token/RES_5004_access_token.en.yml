description: |
  In computer systems, an access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, 
  the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application. 
  Typically one may be asked to enter the access token (e.g. 40 random characters) rather than the usual password 
  (it therefore should be kept secret just like a password).
