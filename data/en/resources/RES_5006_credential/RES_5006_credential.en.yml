description: |
  A credential is a physical/tangible object, a piece of knowledge, or a facet of a person's physical being 
  that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system. 
  Typically, credentials can be something a person knows (such as a number or PIN), 
  something they have (such as an access badge), something they are (such as a biometric feature), 
  something they do (measurable behavioral patterns) or some combination of these items. 
  This is known as multi-factor authentication. The typical credential is an access card or key-fob, 
  and newer software can also turn users' smartphones into access devices.
