description: |
  A password, sometimes called a passcode, is a memorized secret, typically a string of characters, 
  usually used to confirm the identity of a user. Using the terminology of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines, 
  the secret is memorized by a party called the claimant while the party verifying the identity of the claimant 
  is called the verifier. When the claimant successfully demonstrates knowledge of the password 
  to the verifier through an established authentication protocol, the verifier is able to infer the claimant's identity.
