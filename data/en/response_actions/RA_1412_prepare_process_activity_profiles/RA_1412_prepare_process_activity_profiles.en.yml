description: |
  A good knowledge of the usual services running on the machine can
  be very helpful. Don't hesitate to ask a Windows Expert for his
  assistance, when applicable. A good idea is also to have a map of all
  services/running process of the machine.
  
  It can be a real advantage to work in a huge corporate environment,
  where all user machines are the same, installed from a master. Have a
  map of all processes/services/applications. On such environment
  where users are not allowed to install software, consider any
  additional process/service/application as suspicious.
  
  The more you know the machine in its clean state, the more
  chances you have to detect any fraudulent activity running from it.
