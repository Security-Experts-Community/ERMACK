  Scan file system for suspicious files(created or modified). Often these are files that should not be there (in the standard delivery of the system) where they are.
  In the case of a web server, check that there are no extraneous files in directories that have external access. To successfully search for suspicious files, use databases of known IOCs (see references for example).
  Also, some systems (such as content management systems) have functionality to scan for suspicious files.
