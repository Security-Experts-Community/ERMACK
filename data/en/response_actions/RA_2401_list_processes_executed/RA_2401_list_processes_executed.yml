  Processes start every time you launch an application or run a command. While each command creates one process, applications create and run multiple processes for different tasks. By default, each new process starts as a foreground process. This means it must finish before a new process can begin. Running processes in the background allows you to perform other tasks at the same time.
  
  This can be done with different ways : built in tools, administrative tools, automated tools (siem, log management) and etc...
  
  ## Windows
  Use the built in Windows ***tasklist*** command from a command prompt to display all processes, their PIDs, and a variety of other details.
  ```
  C:\>tasklist

  Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
  ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
  System Idle Process              0 Services                   0          8 K
  System                           4 Services                   0      7,428 K
  Secure System                  104 Services                   0     40,344 K
  Registry                       164 Services                   0    146,596 K
  smss.exe                       592 Services                   0      1,176 K
  csrss.exe                      896 Services                   0      6,224 K
  wininit.exe                    980 Services                   0      6,572 K
  ...
  ```
  ## Linux
  To list currently running processes, use the ***ps***, ***top***, ***htop***, and ***atop*** Linux commands. You can also combine the ps command with the pgrep command to identify individual processes.
  
  ## Automation
  Having centralized log collection "to list processes" is a common task, you have an ability to search, filter, compare any content to find interested artifacts.
