  ## Working with registry keys
  Because registry keys are items on PowerShell drives, working with them is very similar to working with files and folders. One critical difference is that every item on a registry-based PowerShell drive is a container, just like a folder on a file system drive. However, registry entries and their associated values are properties of the items, not distinct items.
  
  You can show all items directly within a registry key using Get-ChildItem. Add the optional Force parameter to display hidden or system items. For example, [powershell command]() displays the items directly within PowerShell drive HKCU.
