  Block an external IP address from being accessed by corporate assets, using the most efficient way.
  
  __Warning:__
  - Be careful blocking IP addresses. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster IP address, you should block (if applicable) a specific URL using alternative Response Action
