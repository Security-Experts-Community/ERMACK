description: |
  If possible, isolate the machine via EDR
  
  Or
  
  If the machine is not considered critical for your company and can be disconnected, shut the machine
  down the hard way, removing its power plug. If it is a laptop with a battery on, just push the “off” button
  for some seconds until the computer switches off.
