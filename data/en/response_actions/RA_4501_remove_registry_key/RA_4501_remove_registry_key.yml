  ## Deleting Registry Keys and Values
  To delete a registry key with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) in front of the RegistryPath in the .reg file. 
  
  For example, to delete the Test subkey from the following registry key:

  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software** put a hyphen in front of the following registry key in the .reg file:

  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test** The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task.

  **[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test]** To delete a registry value with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) after the equals sign following the DataItemName in the .reg file. For example, to delete the TestValue registry value from the following registry key:

  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test** put a hyphen after the "TestValue"= in the .reg file. The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task.

  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test**
  
  "TestValue"=- To create the .reg file, use Regedit.exe to export the registry key that you want to delete, and then use Notepad to edit the .reg file and insert the hyphen.
