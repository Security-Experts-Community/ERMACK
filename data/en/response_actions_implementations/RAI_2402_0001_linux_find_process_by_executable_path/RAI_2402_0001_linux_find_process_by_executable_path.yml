  To search for a process by its executable path, we can use standard Linux utilities such as **ps** and **grep**.
  For example, if we need to find all processes whose path contains 'php' we can use the following command:
  
  ``` ps aux | grep 'php' ```
  
  To display only the PID of the found processes, we can use the utility **awk**:
  
  ``` ps aux | grep 'php' | awk '{print $2}'```
