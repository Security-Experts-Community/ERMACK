  Mail deletion script with check for hold parameters, logging and running on a specific server.
  The network exchange in the example takes place over TCP 443.

  Implementation algorithm:  
    1. Session setup  
    2. Check the version of Exchange.  
    3. Implementation of removal  


  ## PowerShell  
  Implementation of the functionality with the some search mechanisms have restrictions.

  **Restrictions:**  
    1) The mechanism searches everywhere, but processes the first 500 boxes    
    2) The mechanism removes only 10 items in the box per pass  
    3) The script is combined with the remote session setup block   
    4) The script is suitable for both local and remote execution
