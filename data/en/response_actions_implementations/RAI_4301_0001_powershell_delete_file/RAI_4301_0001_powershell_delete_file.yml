  To delete the file using PowerShell, we can use the ***Remove-Item*** command. Remove-Item command removes the file from the path specified. For example, we have the file with path: C:\Test\Test.txt.

  To delete the file use the below command.
  ```
  Remove-Item 'C:\Test\test.txt'
  ```
  
  This command deletes a file that's both hidden and read-only.
  ```
  Remove-Item -Path C:\Test\hidden-RO-file.txt -Force
  ```

  It uses the Path parameter to specify the file. It uses the Force parameter to delete it. Without Force, you can not delete read-only or hidden files
