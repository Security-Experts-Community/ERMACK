  To delete the file in Linux system we can use standard utilities such as **rm**
  For example we have the file with path: /home/user/test.txt
  
  To delete the file use below command.
  ```
  rm '/hone/user/test.txt'
  ```
  
  We can also delete a file by its hash using utilities such as **rm**, **find**, **md5sum**, **xargs**, **grep** and **awk**
  For example, we have a file with md5 hash '62e0eeb44c135199947b619de59dc640' in the directory /home/user/test
  
  To delete the file use below command.
  ```
  find /home/user/test -type f -print | xargs md5sum | grep '62e0eeb44c135199947b619de59dc640' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs rm
  ```
