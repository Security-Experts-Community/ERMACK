  To kill the process in Linux system we can use standard utilities such as **kill**
  For example we have a process with name proc and with process ID 123
  
  To kill a process use below command.
  ```
  kill 123
  ```
  
  To kill a process that is listening on port 22 we can use standard utilities such as **fuser**
  For example we have a process that is listening on tcp port 22
  
  To kill a process use below command.
  ```
  fuser -k 22/tcp
  ```
