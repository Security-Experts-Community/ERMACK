  Attackers may attempt to adding shadow credentials for persisting in system or lateral movement using pass the certificate

workflow: |
    1. On identification stage need find <[domain accounts]>(A_1001) which was attacked and from which the attack was carried out. This information can be taken from <[Windows Security event log]>(A_1008) 5136 - Directory service object was modified
    2. On containment stage, when you found the <[account]>(A_1001) from which attack was carried out go to <[Compromised user]> response playbook
    3. On containment stage, when you found an <[account]>(A_1001) that was attacked lock this account
    4. On eradication stage, delete <[msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute]>(A_1015) from attacked account
    5. On recovery stage, unlock previously locked account
    6. Save all <[timestamps]> of implemented actions in Incident Report draft on the fly, it will save a lot of time
