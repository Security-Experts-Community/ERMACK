  Attackers can use pass the certificate attack with certificate which they created themselves (Golden Certificate or Shadow Credentials) or with a stolen certificate. Certificate created by attackers cannot be revoked

    1. On identification stage need find <[domain account]>(A_1001) which was attacked and <[host]>(A_1005) from which attack occur. This information can be taken from <[Windows Security event log]>(A_1008) 4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested
    2. On containment stage, when you found an <[account]>(A_1001) that was attacked lock this account and go to <[Compromised user]> response playbook
    3. On containment stage, when you found the <[host]>(A_1005) from which attack occur go to <[Compromised host]> response playbook
    4. On eradication stage, if certificate has been stolen (this means certificate authority known this certificate) revoke that certificate
    5. On recovery stage, unlock previously locked account and reissue revoked previously certificate
    6. Save all <[timestamps]> of implemented actions in Incident Report draft on the fly, it will save a lot of time
