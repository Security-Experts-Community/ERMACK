  Attackers can theft certificate and private key to authenticate on behalf of the certificate owner using Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) Kerberos extension. Successful "Theft of user certificate and private key" attack quite dangerous, because attackers gets credentials alternative to the password

    1. Identify detected IOCs (tools, commands) used in certificate theft, for find specific artifacts. View the list of created and downloaded files to find stolen certificates or programs used in the attack. Search processes executed with "specific" flags. For example:

        - processes started with args "dump", "exportPFX" or "certificates"
        - process started with well-known flags: crypto::capi, crypto::certificates

    2. Find <[domain account]>(A_1001) whose certificate were theft and <[host]>(A_1005) where these certificates were stored. If it is not possible to identify which certificates were stolen, consider revoking **all certificates** that are stored on the compromised host
    3. When you found <[account]>(A_1001) whose certificate were theft go to [compromised active directory account](/response_playbooks/RP_0009_compromised_active_directory_account/entity) response playbook
    4. When you found <[host]>(A_1005) where these certificates were stored go to [windows host compromised](/response_playbooks/RP_0008_windows_host_compromise/entity) response playbook
    5. On recovery stage, reissue revoked previously <[certificate]>(A_1011)
    6. Save all <[timestamps]> of implemented actions in Incident Report draft on the fly, it will save a lot of time
