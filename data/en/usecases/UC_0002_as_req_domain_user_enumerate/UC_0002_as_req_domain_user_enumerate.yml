  In this attack, attackers use a pecularity of the Kerberos protocol, which allows them to find out if a user with any name exist in domain
  
  ## Attack prerequisites
  1. <[Authentication service]>(A_1010) network availability
  
  ## Attack results
  1. One or more <[domain account]>(A_1001) usernames
  
  ## Attack progress
  ### Study
  #### Username pattern definition
  
  1. Finding user email addresses (T1589.002)
  2. Finding usernames (T1589.003)
  3. Hypothesis about usernames pattern in domain
  
  #### Choose usernames

  1. Selecting usernames from a list of generally or created based information about username pattern
  
  ### Exploitation
  #### Username guessing
  1. Attackers send KRB_AS_REQ message without pre-authentication and with username to <[Authentication service]>(A_1010)
  2. If <[account]>(A_1001) exist in domain, then <[Authentication service]>(A_1010) return response with KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED message, which means user with specified name find, but for success authenticate need send KRB_AS_REQ message with pre-authenticate
  3. If there is no user with this name in the domain, then <[Authentication service]>(A_1010) return response with KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN mesasage.

  ## Some tools for carry out this attack
  1.
  ```shell 
  ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --dc <domain_controller_ip_addr> -d contoso.local users.txt --output found_users.txt
  ```
  2.
  ```shell 
  nmap -Pn -n -p88 --script krb5-enum-users --script-args krb5-enum-users.realm='contoso.local',userdb='users.txt' <domain_controller_ip_addr>
  ```
