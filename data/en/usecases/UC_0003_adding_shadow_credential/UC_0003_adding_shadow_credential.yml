description: Attackers can add key credential (msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute) to target object for persistence or lateral movement in domain
extended_description: |
  Attackers sign the certificate with their private key, create key credential struct and add this struct on msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute to target object.
  After adding this struct attackers can authenticate on behalf of target object using Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) Kerberos extension.

  ## Attack mapping

  | ARTIFACT | OBJECT | DESCRIPTION |
  | :--------| :------| :-----------|
  | **Attack Prerequisites**        |
  | <[Certificate Authority]>(A_1013)     | Server in domain with Certificate Authority Role | Server with Active Directory Certificate Services and Certificate Authority configured |
  | <[Authentication Service]>(A_1010)     | Authentication service on domain controller at least Windows Server 2016 operation system | Authentication Service must have a certificate for Server Authentication for PKINIT |
  | <[Certificate]>(A_1011)     | Certificate signed with the attacker's private key | Certificate signed with the attacker's private key which will be checked during authentication |
  | **Side Observables**            |
  | <[Private key]>(A_1012) | Attackers private key | Attackers private key with which they sign the certificate |

  ## Attack result

  The result of this attack is an record in the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object.

  | RESOURCE | DESCRIPTION |
  | :--------| :-----------|
  | **Attack Prerequisites** |
  | <[Access Right]>(A_1014)     | Write permission to the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object (user or computer) |
  | **Result Consequences** |
  | <[Directory service object attribute]>(A_1015) | Record in msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object (user or computer) |
  | <[Certificate]>(A_1011) | Certificate with which may authentificate on behalf of target object (user or computer) |
  | <[Private key]>(A_1012) | Attackers private key with which they sign the certificate |

  ## Attack progress
  1. Create private key
  2. Create certificate and sign it with private key
  3. Create Key credential struct with signed certificate
  4. Write Key credential struct to msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object

  ## Some tools for carry out this attack
  1.
  ```
  Whisker.exe add /target:targetUserName /path:pathToCertificate.pfx /password:certificatePassword

  Whisker.exe add /target:targetComputerName$ /path:pathToCertificate.pfx /password:certificatePassword
  ```
