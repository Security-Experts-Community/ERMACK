description: Attackers can use valid certificate and associated private key for get Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT)
extended_description: |
  Attackers can use valid certificate and associated private key for get TGT using Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) Kerberos extension. 

  ## Attack mapping 

  | ARTIFACT | OBJECT | DESCRIPTION |
  | :--------| :------| :-----------|
  | **Attack Prerequisites**        |
  | <[Certificate Authority]>(A_1013)     | Server in domain with Certificate Authority Role | Server with Active Directory Certificate Services and Certificate Authority configured |
  | <[Authentication Service]>(A_1010)     | Authentication service on domain controller | Authentication Service must have a certificate for Server Authentication for PKINIT |
  | <[Certificate]>(A_1011)     | Certificate signed with the private key | Certificate signed with the private key which will be checked during authentication |
  | <[Private key]>(A_1012) | Private key associated with the certificate | Private key with which they sign the certificate. Attackers can have access to the private key as a file, or the ability to perform cryptographic operations with the private key without direct access to it (usually this requires code execution from the user context) |
  | **Side Observables**            |
  | <[File]>(A_3002) | PKCS#12 format file (.pfx or .p12) | File with a certificate and an associated private key which is needed to obtain TGT |
  | <[File]>(A_3002) | Executable or script file | Executable or script file that attackers use to carry out an attack (e.g. Rubeus.exe) |

  ## Attack result

  The result of this attack is a Ticket Granting Tickets, which the attacker can use. This means that the attacker was authenticated in the domain on behalf of the user specified in the certificate

  | RESOURCE | DESCRIPTION | 
  | :--------| :-----------|
  | **Attack Prerequisites** |
  | <[Certificate]>(A_1011)     | Certificate signed with the private key which will be checked during authentication |
  | <[Private key]>(A_1012) | Private key with which they sign the certificate. Attackers can have access to the private key as a file, or the ability to perform cryptographic operations with the private key without direct access to it (usually this requires code execution from the user context) |
  | **Result Consequences** |
  | <[Ticket Granting Tickets]>(A_1016) | Ticket Granting Tickets which the attacker can use  |

  ## Attack progress

  Depending on access to the private key (as a file or as the ability to perform cryptographic operations with it), there are two options for attacking

  ### First option - access to the private key as a file

  1. From certificate and an associated private key create PKCS#12 format file
  2. Request TGT with PKCS#12 format file using PKINIT

  #### Some tools for carry out this attack
  1.
  ```
  Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:USER /certificate:certwithkey.pfx /password:pfx_file_password
  ```
  2.
  ```
  certipy auth -pfx certwithkey.pfx -dc-ip 172.16.126.128 -no-hash
  ```

  ### Second option - access to the private key as the ability to perform cryptographic operations with it

  1. From user context, request tgt with specific certificate

  #### Some tools for carry out this attack
  1.
  ```
  Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:USER /certificate:certificate_thumbprint
  ```
