User-Agent string is a piece of metadata associated with the header of a HTTP request and is used for content negotiation as outlined within [RFC1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46).  User-agents may often be overlooked by adversaries, and as such provide a valuable point of investigation.\n\n1. Retrieve the user-agent from the HTTP header.\n2. Using the below methodology as a reference make a judgement as to whether the user-agent provided is suspicious or not.\n\n**Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon string analysis:**\n\n* The user-agent is left empty.\n* The user-agent contains typos or deviations in capitilisation that are different from known good user-agents.\n* The user-agent contains a sequence of random characters or \"gibberish\" akin to those found within MITRE ATT&CK [T1568.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/).\n* The user-agent contains code that would execute an XSS or SQL Injection attack.\n\n**Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon reputational analysis:**\n\n* The user-agent is not listed as a popular user-agent on reference materials such as [WhatIsMyBrowser](https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/useragents/explore/).\n* It should be noted that there is value in engaging with the community on particular User-Agents, and this can often be done by leveraging a search engine such as Google.\n\n **Contextualise your findings with knowledge from your environment.**\n\n* Consider whether the user-agent is relevant for your SoE environment.  For instance, the presence of Mac OS X user-agents in a Windows only environment.\n* Consider performing long-tail analysis or clustering to identify anomalies within your environment.\n\n### Important Considerations\n* User-Agents are client-side generated and can be easily spoofed.  Many adversaries will default to leveraging known-good user-agents to hide activity.\n* User-Agent analysis should be combined with other analysis to improve the fidelity of the signal.

It involves techniques such as reverse engineering, code analysis, and behavioral analysis to identify security threats and inform security defenses.\n\nThe objectives of malware analysis are:\n\n- To identify the type and origin of the malware sample, including its distribution and spread mechanisms.\n- To understand the functionality and behavior of the malware, including its goals and objectives.\n- To identify potential indicators of compromise, such as known malicious signatures or suspicious file formats.\n- To determine the potential threat level posed by the malware and assess the risk to the target environment.\n- To inform response strategies, including mitigation and remediation, to minimize the impact of the malware on the target environment.\n\n## Static Analysis\nStatic analysis is a method of examining malware without executing it. This is typically done by analyzing the code of a binary file to understand its functionality and identify any malicious activity. Static analysis is used to identify potential security threats in a sample without the risk of infecting the analysis environment. It is often used as a first step in malware analysis, to gather initial information and identify potentially malicious code before dynamic analysis is performed.\n\nThe goal of static properties analysis is to gather initial information about the malware sample, including its origin and distribution, and identify any potential indicators of compromise, such as known malicious signatures or suspicious file formats.\n\nThis stage of analysis is performed without the risk of infecting the analysis environment, as the malware is not executed. The results of static properties analysis can be used to inform the next stages of analysis, such as dynamic or manual code reversing.\n\n## Dynamic Analysis\nIn dynamic analysis, the malware sample is executed in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, and its behavior is observed interactively. It involves monitoring the file system, registry, and network activity of the malware as it runs, and observing any malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized connections to remote servers.\n\nInteractive behavior analysis provides a more in-depth understanding of malware behavior than static properties analysis, as it allows security experts to observe the malware’s behavior in real time. The goal is to understand the functionality and capabilities of the malware, including its objectives, and identify any potential indicators of compromise or weaknesses in its behavior.\n\n## Manual vs. Automated Malware Analysis Manual Analysis (Reverse Engineering)\nIn manual analysis, security experts manually examine the code of a malware sample to understand its functionality and behavior. It involves reverse engineering the binary code of the malware, disassembling it, and analyzing the underlying logic and instructions.\n\nThe goal of manual code reversing is to provide a detailed understanding of the malware’s behavior, including its goals and objectives, and identify any potential indicators of compromise or weaknesses in its behavior.It is often performed after initial analysis, such as dynamic or automated analysis, to build a comprehensive understanding of malware behavior.\n\nManual code reversing can be time-consuming and requires specialized skills and knowledge, but provides the highest level of detail and insight into malware behavior. The results of manual code reversing can be used to inform response strategies and improve cybersecurity posture.\n\n## Fully Automated Analysis\nThis stage involves using automated analysis tools, such as sandboxes, to execute and analyze malware in a controlled environment. Automated analysis can provide a more efficient and less time-consuming way of understanding malware behavior, but may not provide the same level of detail as interactive or manual analysis.\n\n## 4 Malware Analysis Best Practices\n### Use a Large Sample of Suspected Malware\nBy analyzing a large and diverse set of malware samples, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of the latest tactics and techniques used by cybercriminals, as well as identify trends and patterns in malware behavior. It helps improve the accuracy of malware detection and analysis and to better understand the behavior of the malware in the target environment.\n\nThis practice can help organizations identify new or previously unknown malware, which can be used to improve their security posture. Additionally, by continuously expanding the malware sample size, organizations can stay up-to-date with the latest developments in malware and the threat landscape, which is critical for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.\n\n### Only Analyze Malware with Active Command and Control (C&C)\nWhen conducting malware analysis, it is important to only analyze malware samples whose remote C&C infrastructure is running to ensure that the full behavior of the malware can be observed and analyzed. This is because many types of malware rely on communication with their remote infrastructure in order to execute their malicious actions.\n\nBy only analyzing malware whose remote infrastructure is running, security researchers can gain a complete understanding of the malware’s behavior and can observe how it interacts with its command and control (C&C) servers, data exfiltration servers, or other remote systems.\n\nAdditionally, analyzing malware whose remote infrastructure is running can provide valuable information about the malware’s infrastructure and operations, which can be used to improve incident response efforts and to take steps to disrupt the malware’s activities.\n\n### Use a Secure Environment to Run Malware\nRunning malware in a secure environment ensures that the analysis is conducted in a controlled and isolated environment, reducing the risk of the malware contaminating the target environment or spreading to other systems. It helps protect sensitive systems and data from damage or theft and can minimize the impact of a security breach.\n\nAdditionally, using a secure environment for malware analysis can help to ensure the accuracy of the analysis results. Malware can be designed to evade detection and analysis by security tools, and running malware in a secure environment can prevent the malware from altering its behavior or hiding its activities from the analyst.\n\nWhen selecting a secure environment for malware analysis, it is important to choose one that provides robust isolation, logging and monitoring capabilities, and that can be configured to meet the specific needs of the analysis. It is also important to regularly update the environment and its components to ensure that they are protected against new threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n### Capture and Store VM Image Snapshots\nVM image snapshots allow security researchers to capture the state of a virtual environment at a specific point in time, providing a permanent record of the malware’s behavior and activities during the analysis.\n\nStoring VM image snapshots allows security researchers to revert to a known good state if the malware causes any harm to the virtual environment, and to review the malware’s activities at a later time. This can be especially valuable when conducting complex malware analysis, as it allows researchers to review their findings and to go back and examine specific stages of the malware’s behavior.\n","tags":""},"path":"/data_ermack/en/response_actions/RA_2313_analyse_windows_pe/RA_2313_analyse_windows_pe.yml"}],["ra_2314_analyse_macos_macho",{"id":"RA2314","text":"RA_2314_analyse_macos_macho","value":1610,"data":{"title":"RA_2314_analyse_macos_macho","id":"RA2314","description":"Analise

When a file is quarantined, the file is moved to a location on disk where it cannot be executed. Users concerned about the contents or data in the infected file should quarantine the infected file, so any important data has a chance to be recovered.\n\nAlso, a virus or infected data file may need to be quarantined if it cannot be removed or cleaned. In this case, the quarantine file that cannot be removed is moved to an area that prevents the virus from infecting other files.\n\nQuarantine allows you to review suspicious and potentially dangerous files from all machines and decide whether they should be removed or restored.
