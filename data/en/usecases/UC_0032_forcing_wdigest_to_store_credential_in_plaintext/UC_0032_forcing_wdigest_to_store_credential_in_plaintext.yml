description: Force WDigest to store secrets in plaintext.
extended_description: |
    
    As part of [WDigest authentication provider](), Windows versions up to 8 and 2012 used to store [logon credentials]() in memory in plaintext by default, which is no longer the case with newer [Windows versions]().
     
    It is still possible, however, to force WDigest to store [secrets]() in plaintext.
    
    Digest Authentication is a challenge/response protocol that was primarily used in Windows Server 2003 for LDAP and web-based authentication. It utilizes Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges to authenticate.

    ## Attack results
    
    Modifying [Windows Registry Key]() responsible for [WDigest credentials]() store makes [secrets]() to be accessible in plaintext.

    ## Attack progress
    1) Let's first make sure that wdigest is not storing credentials in plaintext on our target machine running Windows 10:
    ```
    sekurlsa::wdigest
    ```
    Note the password field is null:

    2) Now as an attacker, we can modify the following registry key to force the WDigest to store credentials in plaintext next time someone logs on to the target system:
    ```
    reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1
    ```
    Now the victim on the target system spawned another shell:
    ```
    runas /user:admin powershell
    ```
    Running [mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/) for wdigest credentials now reveals the plaintext password of the victim user **admin**:
