  On this step, you supposed to know what kind of credentials have been compromised/you would like to revoke.
  You need to revoke them in your Identity and Access Management system where they were created (i.e. Windows AD) using native functionality.

  Warning:

  - If the adversary has generated Golden Ticket in Windows Domain/forest, you have to revoke KRBTGT Account password **twice** for each domain in a forest and proceed to monitor malicious activity for next 20 minutes (Domain Controller KDC service doesnâ€™t perform validate the user account until the TGT is older than 20 minutes old)
