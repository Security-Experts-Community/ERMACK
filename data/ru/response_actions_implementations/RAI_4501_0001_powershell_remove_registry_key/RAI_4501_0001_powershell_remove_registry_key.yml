  To delete the registry key using PowerShell, we can use the ***Remove-Item*** command. Remove-Item command removes the registry key from the path specified. For example, we have the registry key name NodeSoftware stored at the path HKLM, under the Software key.

  To delete the key use the below command.
  ```
  Remove-Item -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NodeSoftware -Force -Verbose
  ```
  The ***Remove-ItemProperty*** cmdlet deletes a property and its value from an item. You can use it to delete registry values and the data that they store.

  These commands delete the "Options" registry value, and its data, from the "MyApp" subkey of "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyCompany".
  ```
  PS C:\> Set-Location HKCU:\Software\MyCompany\MyApp
  PS HKCU:\Software\MyCompany\MyApp> Remove-ItemProperty -Path . -Name "Options" -Confirm
  ```
  The first command uses the ***Set-Location*** cmdlet to change the current location to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER drive (HKCU:) and the Software\MyCompany\MyApp subkey.

  The second command uses ***Remove-ItemProperty*** to remove the "Options" registry value, and its data, from the "MyApp" subkey. Because Path is required, the command uses a dot (.) to indicate the current location. The Confirm parameter requests a user prompt before deleting the value.

  This command deletes the "NoOfEmployees" registry value, and its data, from the HKLM\Software\MyCompany registry key.
  ```
  Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany | Remove-ItemProperty -Name NoOfEmployees
  ```
  The command uses the ***Get-Item*** cmdlet to get an item that represents the registry key. It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the object to ***Remove-ItemProperty***. Then, it uses the Name parameter of ***Remove-ItemProperty*** to specify the name of the registry value.
