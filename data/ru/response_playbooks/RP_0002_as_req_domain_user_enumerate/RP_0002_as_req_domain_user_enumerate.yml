  | <[Domain account]>(A_1001) username     | Find domain usernames that successfully enumed. Check that these accounts have not been compromised                                                                                                 | Find the usernames to which the Authentication service returned KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED message                           |
  | <[Host]>(A_1005)                        | Look on hosts with suspicious activity and go to <[Compromised Host]> response playbook                                                                                                             | Attack tools to carry out an attack or suspicious external network connections                                             |
  | <[IP Address]>(A_1007)                  | Look on IP Address with suspicious network activity and go to <[Compromised Host]> response playbook                                                                                                | KRB_AS_REQ messages without pre-authentication and with atypical usernames for this IP Address or non-existent username    |
  | <[Kerberos network traffic]>(A_1009)    | Look on suspiciously large number KRB_AS_REQ messages without pre-authentication and KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN messages. Spot host from with sends this message and go to <[Compromised Host]>    | Many KRB_AS_REQ messages without pre-authentication and KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN messages                               |

workflow: |
    1. On identification stage need find <[host or hosts]>(A_1005) from which the attack occur. This is can be hosts with suspicious external network connections or attackers footprints (such as attack tools). This is can be <[IP Addreses]>(A_1007) with many KRB_AS_REQ messages without pre-authentication and with atypical usernames for this IP Address or non-existent username
    2. On identification stage need find <[domain account]>(A_1001) usernames which success enumed. This is usernames on which authorization service returned KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED message
    3. After the successfully enumerated users have been found, put this accounts on monitoring
    4. After the compromised hosts have been found, go to <[Compromised Host]> Response Playbook
    5. Save all <[timestamps]> of implemented actions in Incident Report draft on the fly, it will save a lot of time
