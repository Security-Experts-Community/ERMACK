Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.</p>"},{"location":"artifacts/A_1008_log/entity/","title":"A1008: Log","text":""},{"location":"artifacts/A_1008_log/entity/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"ID A1008 Brief Description Chronology Author @Cyberok Creation Date 2023/03/02 Modification Date 2023/03/02 References <ul><li> https://d3fend.mitre.org/dao/artifact/d3f:Log/</li></ul> Ontology mappings <ul><li>d3f:Log</li>"},{"location":"artifacts/A_1008_log/entity/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>A record of events in the order of their occurrence</p>"},{"location":"artifacts/A_1009_privileged_user_account/entity/","title":"A1009: Privileged User Account","text":""},{"location":"artifacts/A_1009_privileged_user_account/entity/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"ID A1009 Brief Description This artifact describes Privileged User Account entity Author Alex@Cyberok Creation Date 2023/03/21 Modification Date 2023/03/22 References <ul><li> https://d3fend.mitre.org/dao/artifact/d3f:PrivilegedUserAccount/</li><li> https://www.ssh.com/iam/user/privileged-account</li></ul> Ontology mappings <ul><li>d3f:PrivilegedUserAccount</li>"},{"location":"artifacts/A_1009_privileged_user_account/entity/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>A privileged account is a user account that has more privileges than ordinary users.

If you have Sysmon installed and auditing of registry keys is enabled, then search for Sysmon events. This example searches for the last 24 hours, but you can set any time range.</p> Powershell command <pre><code>$Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)\nGet-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; StartTime=$Date; Id=12,13,14} | Select-Object TimeCreated, EventID, ProcessId, Image, TargetObject, NewName | Format-Table -AutoSize\n</code></pre> <p>You can show all items directly within a registry key using Get-ChildItem. Add the optional Force parameter to display hidden or system items. For example, this command displays the items directly within PowerShell drive HKCU:, which corresponds to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive: <pre><code>Get-ChildItem -Path HKCU:\\ | Select-Object Name\n</code></pre> Output example: <pre><code>Hive: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\n\nName\n----\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\AppEvents\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\DirectShow\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\dummy\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\EUDC\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Keyboard Layout\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\MediaFoundation\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Microsoft\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Network\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Printers\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\System\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Uninstall\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\WXP\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Volatile Environment\n</code></pre></p> <p>These are the top-level keys visible under HKEY_CURRENT_USER in the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).</p> <p>You can also specify this registry path by specifying the registry provider's name, followed by :: .

You can perform complex filtering based on other properties of items using the Where-Object cmdlet. The following command finds all keys within HKCU:\\Software that have no more than one subkey and also have exactly four values: <pre><code>Get-ChildItem -Path HKCU:\\Software -Recurse |\n  Where-Object {($_.SubKeyCount -le 1) -and ($_.ValueCount -eq 4) }\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_2604_0001_find_account_with_shadow_credential_via_powershell/entity/","title":"RAI2604_0001: Find account with shadow credential via Powershell","text":""},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_2604_0001_find_account_with_shadow_credential_via_powershell/entity/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"ID RAI2604_0001 Brief Description Search via LDAP for an account with the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute Author @SEC Creation Date 2023/05/18 Modification Date 2023/05/18 Requirements <ul><li>  software</li></ul> Tags <ul><li> Powershell</li><li> Windows</li><li> Active Directory</li></ul> Means of action <ul><li> Windows PowerShell<code>cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:powershell:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*</code></li></ul> Targets of action <ul><li> MS Server 2019 with Active Directory role<code>cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:active_directory:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*</code></li></ul> Linked Response Actions <ul><li> Find Compromised User</li></ul>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_2604_0001_find_account_with_shadow_credential_via_powershell/entity/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>You can find all accounts with the given msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute with the following command: <code>Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(msDS-KeyCredentialLink=*)' -Properties msDS-KeyCredentialLink | Select-Object -ExpandProperty msDS-KeyCredentialLink</code></p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/","title":"RAI3303_0001: Perform quarantine file via SOLDR","text":""},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"ID RAI3303_0001 Brief Description This response action is intended to perform quarantine of choosen file Author Alex@Cyberok Creation Date 2023/02/03 Modification Date 2023/03/30 Requirements <ul><li>  software</li></ul> Tags <ul><li> Quarantine</li><li> Linux</li><li> Windows</li><li> Macos</li></ul> Means of action <ul><li> SOLDR<code>cpe:2.3:a:soldr:soldr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*</code></li></ul> Targets of action <ul><li> Windows Host<code>cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*</code></li></ul> Linked Response Actions <ul><li> Quarantine File By Path</li></ul>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Quarantine module sends files to quarantine container directly from the SOLDR (XDR) interface.</p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#target-system-requirements","title":"Target system requirements","text":"<p>Installed SOLDR agent.</p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#requirements-for-means-of-action","title":"Requirements for means of action","text":"<p>Enabled \"Quarantine\" module.</p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#expected-impact-result","title":"Expected impact result","text":"<p>Suspucious file is isolated.</p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3303_0001_soldr_quarantine_file/entity/#implementations","title":"Implementations","text":"<p>Set up module</p> <p>1) some info</p> <p>Module usage example</p> <p>2) more info</p>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3401_0001_soldr_terminate_process/entity/","title":"RAI3401_0001: Terminate process via SOLDR","text":""},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3401_0001_soldr_terminate_process/entity/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"ID RAI3401_0001 Brief Description This response action is intended to terminate process by it's executable path Author Alex@Cyberok Creation Date 2023/02/03 Modification Date 2023/03/30 Requirements <ul><li>  software</li></ul> Tags <ul><li> Terminate</li><li> Linux</li><li> Windows</li></ul> Means of action <ul><li> SOLDR<code>cpe:2.3:a:soldr:soldr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*</code></li></ul> Linked Response Actions <ul><li> Block Process By Executable Path</li></ul>"},{"location":"response_actions_implementations/RAI_3401_0001_soldr_terminate_process/entity/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Terminate process</p> <p>You can remotely terminate processes using the Process terminator module in SOLDR.
